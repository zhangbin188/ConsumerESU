- Enroll using Microsoft account currently logged-in as Windows user.
- Enroll using Microsoft account currently logged-in with Microsoft Store.
- Enroll using current Local account.
- Acquire Consumer ESU license manually as last resort.

Consumer ESU Feature
--------------------

- If the feature is not broadly enabled yet, the script will try to enable it.

- If the script asked to close the session, then close the whole console window, and run the script again (with same parameters if any).

How to enable it manually yourself, this require a reboot to take effect:

- Run *`Command Prompt`* as administrator.
- Execute the following command:  
```
reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\Microsoft\FeatureManagement\Overrides" /v 4011992206 /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
```
- Run *`Windows Powershell`* as administrator.
- Copy and paste the following commands together as-is, wait for "Task Completed" message:  
```
$TN = "ReconcileFeatures"; $TP = "\Microsoft\Windows\Flighting\FeatureConfig\"; $null = Enable-ScheduledTask $TN $TP
Start-ScheduledTask $TN $TP; while ((Get-ScheduledTask $TN $TP).State.value__ -eq 4) {start-sleep -sec 1}; "Task Completed"
#
$TN = "UsageDataFlushing"; $TP = "\Microsoft\Windows\Flighting\FeatureConfig\"; $null = Enable-ScheduledTask $TN $TP
Start-ScheduledTask $TN $TP; while ((Get-ScheduledTask $TN $TP).State.value__ -eq 4) {start-sleep -sec 1}; "Task Completed"
#
```
- **Restart the system**.
- .
- Run *`Command Prompt`* as administrator.
- Execute the following commands:  
```
cmd /c ClipESUConsumer.exe -evaluateEligibility
reg.exe query "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\ConsumerESU"
```
- Verify that the last command shows **ESUEligibility** value as non-zero.  
if so, proceed to run the powershell script as explained above.
- If the value is zero `0x0` or does not exist, then the operation is failed, and you have to wait for official broad availability.
